Topics: EDCC Health Watch , Horse Industry News , Welfare and Industry Share Favorite Please login to bookmark Close Please login to access. ADVERTISEMENT Two horses in El Dorado County, California, are positive for EHM, and 28 exposed horses are under quarantine. | Adobe Stock On June 14, a 20-year-old draft-cross gelding and one additional gelding in El Dorado County, California, were confirmed positive for Equine Herpesvirus Myeloencephalopathy (EHM) secondary to Equine Herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1). Four additional horses on the premises were euthanized within the last week due to unresolving neurologic signs leading to declining clinical status, but they were not tested for EHV-1. Twenty-eight exposed horses at the home premises were quarantined on June 10 with enhanced biosecurity measures implemented. There has been no recent history of travel on or off these premises. EDCC Health Watch is an Equine Network marketing program that utilizes information from the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) to create and disseminate verified equine disease reports. The EDCC is an independent nonprofit organization that is supported by industry donations in order to provide open access to infectious disease information. EHV 101 Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and EHM. RELATED CONTENT: Everything You Need to Know About EHV-1 In many horses, the first or only sign of EHV-1 infection is fever, which can go undetected. In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around eight months) but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from two weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1. Horses with EHM usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop. Herpesvirus is easily spread by nose-to-nose or close contact with an infectious horse; sharing contaminated equipment including bits, buckets, and towels; or clothing, hands, or equipment of people who have recently had contact with an infectious horse. Routine biosecurity measures , including hygiene and basic cleaning and disinfection practices, should be in place at all times to help prevent disease spread. Current EHV-1 vaccines might reduce viral shedding but are not protective against the neurologic form of the disease. Implementing routine biosecurity practices is the best way to minimize viral spread, and the best method of disease control is disease prevention.
