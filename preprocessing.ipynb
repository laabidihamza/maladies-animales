Topics: EDCC Health Watch , Horse Industry News , Welfare and Industry Share Favorite Please login to bookmark Close Please login to access. ADVERTISEMENT Two horses in El Dorado County, California, are positive for EHM, and 28 exposed horses are under quarantine. | Adobe Stock On June 14, a 20-year-old draft-cross gelding and one additional gelding in El Dorado County, California, were confirmed positive for Equine Herpesvirus Myeloencephalopathy (EHM) secondary to Equine Herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1). Four additional horses on the premises were euthanized within the last week due to unresolving neurologic signs leading to declining clinical status, but they were not tested for EHV-1. Twenty-eight exposed horses at the home premises were quarantined on June 10 with enhanced biosecurity measures implemented. There has been no recent history of travel on or off these premises. EDCC Health Watch is an Equine Network marketing program that utilizes information from the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) to create and disseminate verified equine disease reports. The EDCC is an independent nonprofit organization that is supported by industry donations in order to provide open access to infectious disease information. EHV 101 Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and EHM. RELATED CONTENT: Everything You Need to Know About EHV-1 In many horses, the first or only sign of EHV-1 infection is fever, which can go undetected. In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around eight months) but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from two weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1. Horses with EHM usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop. Herpesvirus is easily spread by nose-to-nose or close contact with an infectious horse; sharing contaminated equipment including bits, buckets, and towels; or clothing, hands, or equipment of people who have recently had contact with an infectious horse. Routine biosecurity measures , including hygiene and basic cleaning and disinfection practices, should be in place at all times to help prevent disease spread. Current EHV-1 vaccines might reduce viral shedding but are not protective against the neurologic form of the disease. Implementing routine biosecurity practices is the best way to minimize viral spread, and the best method of disease control is disease prevention.

Topics: EDCC Health Watch , Horse Industry News , Welfare and Industry Share Favorite Please login to bookmark Close Please login to access. ADVERTISEMENT Two horses in El Dorado County, California, are positive for EHM, and 28 exposed horses are under quarantine. | Adobe Stock On June 14, a 20-year-old draft-cross gelding and one additional gelding in El Dorado County, California, were confirmed positive for Equine Herpesvirus Myeloencephalopathy (EHM) secondary to Equine Herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1). Four additional horses on the premises were euthanized within the last week due to unresolving neurologic signs leading to declining clinical status, but they were not tested for EHV-1. Twenty-eight exposed horses at the home premises were quarantined on June 10 with enhanced biosecurity measures implemented. There has been no recent history of travel on or off these premises. EDCC Health Watch is an Equine Network marketing program that utilizes information from the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) to create and disseminate verified equine disease reports. The EDCC is an independent nonprofit organization that is supported by industry donations in order to provide open access to infectious disease information. EHV 101 Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and EHM. RELATED CONTENT: Everything You Need to Know About EHV-1 In many horses, the first or only sign of EHV-1 infection is fever, which can go undetected. In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around eight months) but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from two weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1. Horses with EHM usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop. Herpesvirus is easily spread by nose-to-nose or close contact with an infectious horse; sharing contaminated equipment including bits, buckets, and towels; or clothing, hands, or equipment of people who have recently had contact with an infectious horse. Routine biosecurity measures , including hygiene and basic cleaning and disinfection practices, should be in place at all times to help prevent disease spread. Current EHV-1 vaccines might reduce viral shedding but are not protective against the neurologic form of the disease. Implementing routine biosecurity practices is the best way to minimize viral spread, and the best method of disease control is disease prevention.

         "West Nile detected in Brookings County Subscribe to the Dakota News Now YouTube channel By Dakota News Now staff Published: Jun. 27, 2024 at 8:20 PM UTC+1 BROOKINGS COUNTY, S.D. (Dakota News Now) - The first confirmed West Nile pool of the season has been detected in Brookings County. The Department of Health is urging the public to take precautions to protect themselves and their families from the West Nile virus. Steps that can protect you from West Nile include applying repellents, wearing long sleeves and pants, limiting time outdoors from dusk to midnight and removing any standing water where mosquitos could breed. “Given the rural nature of our state and increased outdoor activities during the summer, protecting yourself against mosquito bites remains an important factor against West Nile infection,” said Dr. Joshua Clayton, State Epidemiologist for the Department of Health. “Something as simple as using bug spray or limiting activities between dusk-to-dawn hours can reduce your infection risk significantly.” Symptoms of West Nile include fever, headaches, rash, swollen lymph nodes, and muscle and joint aches. People with symptoms like severe or unusual headaches should see their physicians. South Dakota has reported more than 2,843 human cases and 53 deaths since WNV was first reported in 2002. Every county has reported cases. For more information on WNV and other health-related items, visit DOH.SD.GOV. Copyright 2024 Dakota News Now. All rights reserved.",

According to Mayahi, Dhi Qar has recorded 18 cases and 3 deaths in 2024, with half of the cases occurring in the Shatra district. Nineveh and Baghdad have each confirmed six cases. One death has been recorded in each province. Babil province has four cases and one death. There was no recent data immediately available for the Kurdistan Region. The Crimean-Congo fever is a tick-borne illness that causes severe hemorrhaging. It has been endemic to Iraq since 1979 and has appeared in greater numbers since 2021, sparking fear among locals, especially in southern provinces. The disease can be transmitted from one infected human to another by contact with infectious blood or other body fluids, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Some symptoms of the fever include bleeding, severe headaches, fatigue, blue marks on the skin and blood in the urine.

The strain found at the... more A highly infectious strain of avian influenza has been detected at a second Sydney farm in the Hawkesbury region, which will require authorities to euthanise 87,000 birds over the next seven weeks. The case was confirmed by the NSW government on Saturday night, and was found 1.5km from the farm where the initial case of bird flu was detected last week. Testing by the CSIRO’s Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness (ACDP) confirmed the strain as High Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H7N8 – the same strain which was detected at the nearby farm. The confirmed case at a second Sydney egg farm will lead to the culling of 87,000 birds over the next week. Picture: Brandon Bell/ Getty Images via AFP However the virus is not the same strain ravaging seven farms in Victoria, or the H5N1 virus which has infected more than 97 million birds and 118 dairy herds in the United States. The second farm has been locked down since Wednesday, after the bird flu was detected at a large mixed barnyard and free-range poultry farm, affecting about 240,000 birds. The outbreak is believed to be from a spillover event, like potential infection from a wild bird. A 2km lockdown order was immediately implemented, which covered three other large commercial poultry farms, including the farm where Saturday’s detection was confirmed. Workers at a chicken farm in Meredith, Victoria pictured going through a cleaning station before they enter the farm. Picture: NewsWire/ Mike Dugdale The order restricted the movement of eggs, birds and machinery within the lockdown site, More Coverage Emergency declared over bird flu NSW Agriculture Minister Tara Moriarty thanked the support and collaboration of the poultry industry, and said the virus didn’t affect eggs and poultry meat, which was safe to eat as long as its handled and cooked according to safe food practices. Supply chains have largely remained unaffected, however Coles has implemented a two dozen buying limit on all states and territories except for Western Australia. People have been urged to report any sick and dead birds “as a priority” through the Emergency Animal Disease Hotline on 1800 675 888.

         "Brazos County confirms West Nile Virus detected in the area The mosquito trap that collected the positive samples was located in the 77845 zip code of College Station. Brazos County confirms West Nile Virus from a sample in College Station(KBTX) By Rusty Surette Published: Jul. 2, 2024 at 9:43 PM UTC+1 BRYAN, Texas (KBTX) - The Brazos County Health District Vector Surveillance Program has confirmed mosquito samples collected in Brazos County have tested positive for West Nile Virus. The mosquito trap that collected the positive samples was located in south College Station. “Please keep in mind that all of Brazos County should be considered positive for WNV and residents should take the necessary steps to reduce exposure to mosquitoes,” Community Relations Manager Felicia Benford said. The Brazos County Health District conducts Mosquito Surveillance with weekly trapping in Bryan and College Station from May to October. They monitor for the presence of West Nile Virus, St Louis Encephalitis Virus, and Eastern Equine Encephalitis Virus. Enhanced surveillance including additional traps and larvicide treatments will begin as specified in the Brazos County Health District Phased Response Guidelines. Residents in all areas of Bryan, College Station, and the Brazos Valley area should empty and eliminate any standing water in containers on their property and ensure that lawn irrigation and onsite sewage systems are functioning properly. There are no medications to treat, or vaccines to prevent West Nile Virus infection. “Just continue about your normal day,” the head of the Vector Surveillance Program, Ashleigh Brand, said. “If you are going to do bug sprays, try to look for something with DEET in it, DEET is always the way to go.” All Brazos County residents are urged to use the 4D’s to reduce exposure to biting mosquitoes: • DEET All day, Every Day: Whenever outside, use and reapply insect repellents including the active ingredient DEET or other EPA-registered repellents and always follow label instructions. • Dress: Wear long, loose, and light-colored clothing outside. • Dusk and Dawn: Limit spending time outdoors when mosquitoes are most active. • Drain: Drain or treat with larvicide all standing water in and around your home or workplace where mosquitoes could lay eggs. West Nile Virus is transmitted through the bite of infected mosquitoes. Most people exposed to the virus do not get sick, but about 20% develop symptoms like headache, fever, body aches, joint pains, nausea, and fatigue. Copyright 2024 KBTX. All rights reserved.",

Steps that can protect you from West Nile include applying repellents, wearing long sleeves and pants, limiting time outdoors from dusk to midnight and removing any standing water where mosquitos could breed. “Given the rural nature of our state and increased outdoor activities during the summer, protecting yourself against mosquito bites remains an important factor against West Nile infection,” said Dr. Joshua Clayton, State Epidemiologist for the Department of Health. “Something as simple as using bug spray or limiting activities between dusk-to-dawn hours can reduce your infection risk significantly.” Symptoms of West Nile include fever, headaches, rash, swollen lymph nodes, and muscle and joint aches. People with symptoms like severe or unusual headaches should see their physicians. South Dakota has reported more than 2,843 human cases and 53 deaths since WNV was first reported in 2002. Every county has reported cases. For more information on WNV and other health-related items, visit DOH.SD.GOV. Copyright 2024 Dakota News Now. All rights reserved.",

         "China reports another fatal H5N6 avian flu case News brief June 20, 2024 Lisa Schnirring Topics Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) SHARE China has reported another fatal human infection involving H5N6 avian flu, its third of the year, according to an avian influenza update from the World Health Organization (WHO) Western Pacific regional office. Juhan Sonin / Flickr cc The patient is a 41-year man from Fujian province in the country's southeast whose symptoms began on May 8. He had severe pneumonia and was hospitalized, where his respiratory samples tested positive on May 14. He died from his infection. The report did not say how the man is thought to have contracted the virus. China's last H5N6 case, reported in May, was also from Fujian province and likewise fatal. H5N6 is known to circulate in poultry in China and a few other Asian countries. Infections in humans are often severe or fatal. So far only China and Laos have reported H5N6 cases in people. The WHO said the man's illness raises the number of H5N6 cases to 92 and the fatality total to 37. Rebyota fecal transplant offers durable protection after antibiotic exposure, study finds News brief June 20, 2024 Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship Clostridium difficile CDC / Jennifer Oosthuizen A microbiota-based live biotherapeutic for treating recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI) remained effective after subsequent antibiotic exposure, researchers reported this week in Open Forum Infectious Diseases. In a post-hoc analysis of a phase 2 trial evaluating the safety, efficacy, and durability of Rebyota fecal microbiota transplantation for preventing rCDI, the researchers evaluated patients who received non-CDI antibiotics for up to 2 years after Rebyota administration. Although Rebyota has been found to be highly effective in preventing rCDI and was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in December 2022, the researchers wanted to assess the durability of the treatment response, particularly in patients subsequently exposed to antibiotics, which can disrupt the gut microbiome and increase the risk of rCDI. They looked specifically at non-CDI antibiotics, because any recurrence of CDI would require antibiotic treatment. Treatment response was defined as the absence of CDI diarrhea needing retreatment as of the last evaluable time point (8 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, or 2 years) after Rebyota administration. Durable response Of the 149 participants in the trial, 43 received non-CDI antibiotics after Rebyota administration over a 2-year period. Across all evaluable time points, 37 of 43 (86%) had treatment response regardless of when non-CDI antibiotic exposure occurred, with treatment response rates ranging from 83% to 96% at the various time points. Among participants with treatment response, success was sustained for a median of 470 days from the first initial non-CDI antibiotic use. Of the six participants who experienced rCDI, 5 received a high-risk antibiotic. Although the study was limited by lack of a control group and other factors, the researchers say the findings provide evidence that Reboyota offers durable protection after antibiotic exposure in a real-world population. \"Irrespective of the inherent limitations of this analysis, these results suggest RBL [Rebyota] may restore the gut microbiota to a sufficient threshold protective against rCDI for many patients despite subsequent non-CDI antibiotic use,\" they wrote. Analysis finds jump in extensively drug-resistant gonorrhea in Cambodia News brief June 20, 2024 Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship Gonorrhea Sexually Transmitted Infections Analysis of gonorrhea samples in Cambodia found sustained transmission of ceftriaxone-resistant strains and a threefold jump in extensively drug-resistant (XDR) isolates, researchers reported this week in Emerging Infectious Diseases. iLexx / iStock For the study, researchers with Cambodia's National Center for HIV/AIDS, Dermatology, and Sexually Transmitted Diseases and the World Health Organization (WHO) performed antimicrobial susceptibility tests and genomic analysis on 72 Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates collected in 2023 through the WHO's Enhanced Gonococcal Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (EGASP). Under EGASP protocols, public health alerts are sent upon identification of strains approaching resistance. A 'substantial threat' for gonorrhea control EGASP alert minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for ceftriaxone and cefixime—two first-line treatment options for gonorrhea—were detected in 22 (31%) of 72 isolates, a proportion similar to that reported in 2022 (38%). But 9 isolates (12.5%) had the XDR phenotype, which combines ceftriaxone resistance and high-level azithromycin resistance, and all belonged to the same sequence type (ST-16406). That's up from 4% in 2022. In addition, the percentage of isolates with high resistance to ciprofloxacin and penicillin remained high (82% to 97%). Genomic analysis of 54 isolates with ceftriaxone alert MICS in 2022 and 2023 found that 50 carried the same resistance mutation (the penA-60.001 allele), and 4 harbored recently described or novel mutations. Furthermore, sequences from only 8 isolates clustered with a widely disseminated, ceftriaxone-resistant clone (FC428). \"Our data provide further evidence for sustained transmission of N. gonorrhoeae strains with elevated MICs for ceftriaxone and increased expansion of isolates with elevated MICs to ceftriaxone and azithromycin that genomically cluster with the XDR N. gonorrhoeae phenotype,\" the study authors wrote. \"Furthermore, strains with elevated MICs for ceftriaxone continue to emerge across different phylogenetic backbones separate from the previously described FC428 clone, confirming concerns that biological fitness is not compromised by that allele and consequently poses a substantial threat for gonococcal disease control.\" They add that the findings, combined with recent reports of rising ceftriaxone resistance in China, highlight the need to prioritize gonococcal antimicrobial resistance surveillance across the Asia-Pacific region. Dengue surge in the Americas tops 9 million cases News brief June 20, 2024 Lisa Schnirring Topics Dengue For the first half of 2024, dengue cases in the Americas region have already surpassed yearly maximums, and cases have already doubled those of 2023, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) said this week in its latest epidemiologic update. frank600 / iStock So far more than 9.3 million cases have been reported by 43 countries and territories. About half were lab confirmed. Of the total, 9,592 were severe and 4,529 were fatal. Six countries accounted for nearly all the deaths: mostly Brazil, followed by Argentina, Peru, Paraguay, Colombia, and Ecuador. Compared to both 2023 and 5-year case averages, cases were up most sharply in the Caribbean region, followed by the Southern Cone, Central America and Mexico, and Andean-region countries. All 4 serotypes circulating All four dengue virus serotypes have been circulating in the Americas, with levels varying by country. All four are circulating simultaneously in Brazil, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and Panama. The agency urged countries to continue their surveillance, diagnosis, treatment, and vector control activities. PAHO also said clustering of cases is also common with diseases including dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. \"Efforts should be made to analyze the spatial distribution of cases to enable a rapid response at the local level in the most affected areas,\" it said. \"Information from the hotspots of the three diseases should be targeted for intensive vector control.\" Report details effective Tpoxx distribution in LA County News brief June 20, 2024 Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics Mpox Today in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, authors describe the distribution of the antiviral drug tecovirimat (Tpoxx) in Los Angeles County during the 2022-23 global mpox outbreak, which was spread largely among men who have sex with men. Los Angeles was one of the epicenters of the mpox outbreak in the United States, and public health officials quickly developed a hub-and-spoke distribution model to deliver the antivirals to those who had been exposed to the virus, consisting of 44 hub facilities serving 456 satellite sites across the county, with two-thirds being clinics or pharmacies. This strategy was built on the COVID-19 vaccine rollout. \"This strategy was built on the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, for which clinics and pharmacies were crucial to vaccine distribution networks,\" the authors said. Median time to treatment was 2 days Thirty-nine percent of all California mpox cases occurred in Los Angeles County, the most populous county in the state. By January 31, 2023, 2,281 patients with mpox were reported in the county, and approximately one-third (735; 32%) had been treated with tecovirimat. \"120 (16%) patients who received tecovirimat were treated at pharmacies, 227 (31%) at hospitals, and 388 (53%) at community clinics,\" the authors wrote. The median interval from specimen collection to treatment was 2 days, and the average patient age was 38. \"Overall, the distribution strategy was effective and sufficient to meet increasing needs. Similar strategies might benefit tecovirimat distribution in different jurisdictions as would other prepositioned therapeutics for mpox or future emerging infections,\" the authors concluded.

Topics: EDCC Health Watch , Horse Industry News , Welfare and Industry Share Favorite Please login to bookmark Close Please login to access. ADVERTISEMENT Two horses in El Dorado County, California, are positive for EHM, and 28 exposed horses are under quarantine. | Adobe Stock On June 14, a 20-year-old draft-cross gelding and one additional gelding in El Dorado County, California, were confirmed positive for Equine Herpesvirus Myeloencephalopathy (EHM) secondary to Equine Herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1). Four additional horses on the premises were euthanized within the last week due to unresolving neurologic signs leading to declining clinical status, but they were not tested for EHV-1. Twenty-eight exposed horses at the home premises were quarantined on June 10 with enhanced biosecurity measures implemented. There has been no recent history of travel on or off these premises. EDCC Health Watch is an Equine Network marketing program that utilizes information from the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) to create and disseminate verified equine disease reports. The EDCC is an independent nonprofit organization that is supported by industry donations in order to provide open access to infectious disease information. EHV 101 Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and EHM. RELATED CONTENT: Everything You Need to Know About EHV-1 In many horses, the first or only sign of EHV-1 infection is fever, which can go undetected. In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around eight months) but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from two weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1. Horses with EHM usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop. Herpesvirus is easily spread by nose-to-nose or close contact with an infectious horse; sharing contaminated equipment including bits, buckets, and towels; or clothing, hands, or equipment of people who have recently had contact with an infectious horse. Routine biosecurity measures , including hygiene and basic cleaning and disinfection practices, should be in place at all times to help prevent disease spread. Current EHV-1 vaccines might reduce viral shedding but are not protective against the neurologic form of the disease. Implementing routine biosecurity practices is the best way to minimize viral spread, and the best method of disease control is disease prevention.

ADVERTISEMENT Two horses in El Dorado County, California, are positive for EHM, and 28 exposed horses are under quarantine. | Adobe Stock On June 14, a 20-year-old draft-cross gelding and one additional gelding in El Dorado County, California, were confirmed positive for Equine Herpesvirus Myeloencephalopathy (EHM) secondary to Equine Herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1). Four additional horses on the premises were euthanized within the last week due to unresolving neurologic signs leading to declining clinical status, but they were not tested for EHV-1. Twenty-eight exposed horses at the home premises were quarantined on June 10 with enhanced biosecurity measures implemented.",
